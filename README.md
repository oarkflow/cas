Here’s a structured breakdown of what I see in the current design, along with areas for improvement:

---

## 1. Major Correctness & Safety Issues

1. **Concurrent Access to userRoleMap**
   - You protect writes with a.m.Lock(), but reads from userRoleMap (e.g. in resolvePrincipalPermissions / resolvePrincipalRoles) aren’t guarded by any lock.
   - **Risk:** Data race, inconsistent view of roles.

2. **Inefficient Removal in RemovePrincipalRole**
   - You rebuild a.userRoles slice by full scan on each removal. For high-volume role churn this is O(N) per call.

3. **Expiry Checking**
   -  PrincipalRole.IsExpired() uses time.Now() per check; in tight loops (e.g. deep tenant trees) this could be costly and non-deterministic in tests.

4. **Error Handling Inconsistency**
   - SetExpiry returns fmt.Errorf("expiry time has to be in future"), but other methods mix returning error vs. swallowing errors.

---

## 2. Performance Bottlenecks

1. **Global Scan of a.userRoles**
   - Every call to resolvePrincipalPermissions / resolvePrincipalRoles loops all a.userRoles for each tenant in the hierarchy.
   - **Impact:** O(R × T) where R=#roles, T=#tenants in the tree.

2. **Per-Request Graph Traversals Without Caching**
   - DAG lookups (ResolvePermissions and ResolveChildRoles) cache only at the role level, but you still recompute permission sets for every (user, tenant, namespace, scope) request.

3. **Pools with clear(map)**
   - Using pooled maps is good, but clear(m) still iterates over all keys. In worst case this equals a full map scan per request.

4. **Slice Copy for Tenant Buffer**
   - Copying into a fixed-length array on each findTargetTenants call is negligible unless usually >10 tenants—but beware if you bump this buffer size.

---

## 3. Missing Features & Edge-Cases

1. **Wildcard & Hierarchical Resources**
   - No support for permission patterns such as resource/* or resource:subresource.

2. **Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC)**
   - Only pure RBAC with static roles & scopes. No dynamic attributes (e.g. time of day, IP address, request context).

3. **Permission Denials & Negative Roles**
   - No way to explicitly deny a permission or override inherited grants.

4. **Bulk Role/Permission Assignments**
   - No batch APIs, making initial provisioning or migrations cumbersome.

5. **Event Hooks / Observability**
   - Aside from audit logging on Can/Authorize, there are no hooks for subscription (e.g. “on role added”, “on permission changed”).

6. **Caching / TTL Invalidation**
   - No higher-level caching of resolved principal → permissions/roles, with TTL or explicit invalidation on role/permission change.

---

## 4. Suggested Enhancements

1. **Locking & Thread-Safety**
   - Wrap all userRoleMap and a.userRoles accesses in RLock/RUnlock for readers. Consider sharding roles per principal to reduce contention.

2. **Indexing for Fast Lookups**
   - Maintain maps of principal→tenant→roles so you don’t scan the full a.userRoles slice. You already have userRoleMap, but your resolution loops over userRoles; switch to map lookups.

3. **Cache Resolved Permissions per (user, tenant, namespace, scope)**
   - Introduce a small LRU cache with TTL to avoid recomputing on every request. Invalidate on role/permission changes.

4. **Support Wildcards & Hierarchical Matching**
   - Extend utils.MatchResource (or wrap it) to allow patterns like org/* or */read.

5. **ABAC / Policy Engine**
   - Integrate a simple expression evaluator (e.g. CEL) so policies can refer to request context or object attributes.

6. **Negative Permissions / Deny Overrides**
   - Add an optional “deny” permission set that takes precedence over grants; prevents the “role explosion” when you need to remove a single right.

7. **Bulk Operations & Batching**
   - Add methods like AddPrincipalRoles([]PrincipalRole) and RemovePrincipalRoles(criteria), minimizing locks and scans.

8. **Observability & Metrics**
   - Instrument resolution counts, latencies, cache hit rates. Expose Prometheus metrics.

9. **Testing & Determinism**
   - Inject a clock interface rather than using time.Now(), so expiry tests can control time.

10. **Audit Log Improvements**
    - Include before/after role snapshots on changes, and support “reason” fields.

---

## 5. New Ideas & Next-Level Suggestions

- **Hierarchical Tenancy with Inheritance Rules**
  - Allow tenants to opt-in/opt-out of inherited roles from parents, with explicit override flags.

- **Delegated Administration**
  - Introduce “role templates” or “permission bundles” that admins can assign en masse.

- **UI-Driven Role Management**
  - Expose an API for administering roles, permissions, tenants, scopes; back it with generated swagger or OpenAPI spec.

- **Policy-as-Code**
  - Store policies in files or Git, with versioning and review workflows.

- **Simulation & Dry-Run**
  - Provide an API to “simulate” a set of assignments and see the effective permissions, without applying them.

- **Graph Visualization**
  - Export your RoleDAG to DOT/Graphviz for visual inspection of role hierarchies.

These changes will help you move from a working prototype toward a production-grade, scalable, secure, and maintainable authorizer. Let me know if you’d like to dive deeper into any specific area or see code examples for any of these suggestions!
